    "In this work, we extended the SEIR model to model the disease spread with a higher resolution. To this end, the *infected pool* is split into four types of infectiousness: 1) supermild (SM): people who show little to no symptoms at all, 2) mild (M): people with noticable, mild covid-19 symptoms, 3) heavy (H): people hospitalised but not in need of intensive care and 4) critical (C): people hospitalised and in need of intensive care. It takes several days before a heavy or critical infection becomes so severe that these patients need to be hospitalised. To this end, the pool of heavily and critically infected patients is split in two: not yet hospitalised (H, C) and hospitalised (HH,CH). The *removed pool* from the classical SEIR model is explicitly split into an immune (I) and dead (F) pool. People from the susceptible, exposed, supermild infected, mild infected and immune pool can be quarantined after having tested positive for covid-19. In the flowchart below, quarantine pools are denoted by the *Q*-suffix. Note that for individuals in the susceptible and immune pools, this corresponds to receiving a false positive test.\n",

    "### Deterministic vs. Stochastic framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended SEIR model is implemented using two frameworks: a deterministic and a stochastic (network based) framework. **This Jupyter Notebooks is a demo of the deterministic model, the stochastic model works but is not yet integrated with our current methods.** A deterministic implementation of the extended SEIRS model captures important features of infectious disease dynamics, but it assumes uniform mixing of the population (i.e. every individual in the population is equally likely to interact with every other individual). The deterministic approach results in a set of N ordinary differential equations, one for every of the N ’population pools’ considered. The main advantage of the deterministic model is that a low amount of computational resources are required while still maintaining an acceptable accuracy. The deterministic framework allows to rapidly explore scenarios and perform optimisations which require thousands of function evaluations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is often important to consider the structure of contact networks when studying disease transmission and the effect of interventions such as social distancing and contact tracing. The main drawback of the deterministic approach is the inability to simulate contact tracing, which is one of the most promising measures against the spread of sars-cov-2. For this reason, the SEIRS dynamics depicted in on the above flowchart can be simulated on a stochastic dynamical network. This advantages include a more detailed analysis of the relationship between social network structure and effective transmission rates, including the effect of network-based interventions such as social distancing, quarantining, and contact tracing. The first drawback is the increased amount of computational resources required, leading to the inability to perform optimisations on a personal computer. Instead, high performance computing infrastructure is needed. The second drawback is the need for more data and/or assumptions on social interactions and how government measures affect these social interactions.\n",

    "Consider a network graph G like the one depicted below, representing individuals (nodes) and their interactions (edges). Each individual (node) has a state (S, E, SM, M, H, C, HH, CH, R, F, SQ, SMQ, MQ or RQ). The set of nodes adjacent (connected by an edge) to an individual defines their set of \"close contacts\" (highlighted in black). At a given time, each individual makes contact with a random individual from their set of close contacts with probability (1-p) or with a random individual from anywhere in the network (highlighted in blue) with probability p. The latter global contacts represent individuals interacting with the population at large. These are individuals outside of ones inner social circle, such as on public transit, at an event or chatting to an old acquaintance etc. When a susceptible individual interacts with an exposed or infectious individual they become exposed themselves. The parameter p defines the locality of the network: for p=0 an individual only interacts with their close contacts, while p=1 represents a uniformly mixed population. **For a sufficiently large network G, and $p = 1$, the stochastic and deterministic framework will yield the same result**. Social distancing interventions ifluences both the locality and connectivity of the network. It is expected that social distancing lowers the average number of interactions an individual has each day (lower connectivity of the network). But as a result, the fraction of interactions in the inner circle increases, lowering p.\n",

    "In the above equations, S stands for susceptible, E for exposed, SM for supermild, M for mild, H for heavy, C for critical, HH for heavy and hospitalised, CH for critical and hospitalised, F for dead, R for immune. The quarantined states are SQ, which stands for susceptible and quarantined, EQ for exposed and quarantined, SMQ for supermild infected and quarantined, MQ for mildly infected and quarantined and RQ for recovered and quarantined. N stands for the total population. The clinical parameters are: sm, m, z, h: the chance of having an asymptotic, mild, heavy or critical infection. Based on reported cases in China and travel data, Li et al. (2020b) estimated that 86 % of coronavirus infections in the country were \"undocumented\" in the weeks before officials instituted stringent quarantines. A biotech company in Iceland that has tested more than 9,000 people found that around 50 percent of those who tested positive said they were asymptomatic. We assume that 50 % of all infected cases are supermild (asymptotic) and hence,\n",

    "$d_{sm}$ , $d_m$ , $d_h$ : the number of symptomic days in case of a supermild, mild or heavy infection. $d_{hf}$ is the time from hospitalisation until death in case of a critical infection while $d_{hr}$ is the recovery time for critical cases. Zhou et al. (2020) performed a retrospective study on 191 Chinese hospital patients and determined that the time from illness onset to discharge or death was 22.0 days (18.0-25.0, IQR) and 18.5 days (15.0-22.0, IQR) for survivors and victims respectively. Using available preliminary data, the World Health Organisation estimated the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases to be approximately 2 weeks and to be 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease (WHO, 2020). Based on this report, we assume a recovery time of three weeks for heavy infections. d hospital : the time before heavily or critically infected patients reach the hospital. On average this is 9.1 days (Li et al., 2020a). m c : the mortality in case of a critical infection, which is roughly 50% (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). It is assumed that if the number of critical cases surpasses the total number of ICU beds, the mortality is changed to the average between 0.49 and 1, with the fraction of patients in critical condition receiving care as a weight. This is formulated mathematically in the following way,\n",

Throughout this demo, we assume $\\zeta = 0$ because data on seasonality is not yet available at the moment. We thus assume permanent immunity after recovering from the infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmission rate of the disease in the deterministic model depends on the product of three contributions. The first contribution, $(E+SM)/N$, is the probability of encountering a contagious individual. The second contribution, $N_c$, is the average number of human-to-human interactions per day. As previously explained, **in the deterministic framework, this means all $N_c$ contacts within the population are random**. In this work, we explictly split $\\beta$ and $N_c$ because this has the following advantages: 1) $\\beta$ is now a disease characteric, independent of social interactions. 2) The goal of this work is to demonstrate the concept of social control to contain the outbreak using model predictive control. By splitting $\\beta$ and $N_c$, the controlled variable is the number of random contacts $N_c$ which is more comprehendible to the reader of this text. The number of human-human interactions per day is estimated using the Social Contact Rates (SOCRATES) Data Tool (Willem et al., 2020). The dataset on human-human interactions for Belgium is based on a 2008 study by Mossong, which kept track of 750 participants and their interactions (8878 interactions) in Belgium. The dataset includes both physical and non-physical interactions of any duration. The third contribution, $\\beta$, is the probability of contracting sars-cov-2 when encoutering a contagious individual. The testing and quarantine parameters are: $\\theta_{S}$, $\\theta_{E}$, $\\theta_{SM}$, $\\theta_{M}$, $\\theta_{R}$ expressed as the number of susceptibles, exposed, supermild and mild individuals tested each day. It is difficult to model a concrete testing scenario in the deterministic framework because no back tracing can be coupled to the tests. The deterministic model only considers random testing of the population. It uses the total daily testing capacity to calculate the amount of individuals in the S, E, SM, M and R pool that receive a test. $\\psi_{PP}$: probability of correctly identifiying and quarantining an exposed or infected person. $\\psi_{FP}$: probability of falsly identifying and quarantining a susceptible or recovered individual. Both parameters can be calculated using the reliability of the test and Bayes theorem. For now, we assume no false positives. $d_{\\text{q,FP}}$: the duration of the quarantine in the case of a false positive, assumed to be 14 days.\n",

    "The basic concept of object oriented programming in Python 3 is illustrated schematically below. An object, created by calling a class, should be seen as a 'box' containing 'tools'. First, the model parameters, the initial condition and the monte-carlo simulation settings are put inside. The toolbox 'SEIRSAgeModel' not only contains the necessary code to simulate the model, but also contains several convenient functions for data visualisation, calibration of model parameters and model predictive control. The advantage of using an object instead of nested functions is the fact that function arguments don't explicitly have to be passed to the helper functions every time these are called by the user. Rather, the parameters are stored in our 'SEIRSAgeModel' toolbox and can be used by the class functions at any time. This drastically enhances the readability of the code.\n",

The initial conditions must be 1D arrays with the same size as the number of age categories considered in the metapopulation model. Nc must be a square 2D array with the same size as the number of age categories considered in the metapopulation model. For now, we ommit age-structuring as this is demonstrated later on.** We conveniently name our object 'model'."

    "#### Creating an age-structured SEIRSAgeModel object\n",
    "A first important challenge when using a deterministic model is to link the discrete levels of the control handle Nc (number of contacts) to specific government policies. A model extension that could be used to facilitate this is age-structuring. In this approach, all population pools are split in age-bins and the interactions between the age-bins are governed by a so-called interaction matrix. This modeling approach was recently used by a team of the London School of Hygiene and details can be found here [1]. Our model is written in such a way that incorporating age-structuring is only a matter of change the initial conditions and Nc-matrix sizes. We can already run simulations using the Belgian interaction matrix shown below and we will run the controller using this model in the very near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now initialise a second, age-structured, 'toolbox', as shown in the cell below.  This is done in exactly the same way as before but instead of size-one numpy arrays we will now use a 16x16 interaction interaction matrix and 16x0 size initial conditions, as was demonstrated by the London School of Hygiene. Interaction matrices are publicly available here [2]. We conveniently name our object 'ageModel'.\n",

    "#### Process control for the layman\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have the impression that the control part, which we see as our main addition to the problem, is more difficult to grasp for the layman, here is a short intro to process control. Experts in control are welcome to skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predictive model consists of a set of equations and aims to predict how the system will behave in the future given a certain input. Process control flips this around and aims at determining what input is needed to achieve a desired system behavior (= goal). It is a tool that helps us in “controlling” how we want a system to behave. It is commonly applied in many industries, but also in our homes (e.g. central heating, washing machine). It's basically everywhere. Here's how it works. An algorithm monitors the deviation between the goal and the true system value and then computes the necessary action to \"drive\" the system to its goal by means of an actuator (in industry this is typically a pump or a valve). Applying this to Covid-19, the government wants to \"control\" the spread of the virus in the population by imposing measures (necessary control actions) on the public (which is the actuator here) and achieve the goal that the number of severely sick people does not become larger than can be handled by the health care system. However, the way the population behaves is a lot more complex compared to the heating control in our homes since not only epidemiology (virus spread) but also different aspects of human behavior on both the individual and the societal level (sociology, psychology, economy) are involved. This leads to multiple criteria we want to ideally control simultaneously and we want to use the \"smartest\" algorithm we can get our hands on.\n",

    "#### The optimizePolicy function\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'SEIRSAgeModel' class contains an implementation of the MPC controller in the function *optimizePolicy*. For now, the controller minimises a weighted squared sum-of-errors between multiple setpoints and model predictions. The algorithm can use any variable to control the virus outbreak, but we recommend sticking with the number of random daily contacts $N_c$ and the total number of random tests ('totalTests') as only these have been tested. We also recommend disabling age-structuring in the model before running the MPC as this feature requires discretisation of the interaction matrix to work which is not yet implemented. Future work will extend the MPC controller to work with age-structuring feature inherent to the model. Future work is also aimed at including an economic cost function to discriminate between control handles. Our MPC uses the **genetic algorithm** from scipy.optimize to perform the optimisation, we recommend using at least a populationsize of 20 and at least 100 iterations to ensure that the trajectory is 'optimal'. The *optimizePolicy* function has the following basic syntax,\n",

    "> - bounds: A list containing the lower- and upper boundaries of each parameter to be used as a control handle. Each entry in the list should be a 1D numpy array containing the lower- and upper bound for the respective control handle.\n",
    "> - setpoints: A list with the numerical values of the desired model output.\n",
    "> - positions: a list containing the model states (dtype=np.array) used to calculate the sum of least squares. Each modelouput in the given position is matched with a provided setpoint. If multiple position entries are provided, the output in these positions is added togheter. The order of the states is given according to the following vector, where S has index 0: (S, E, SM, M, H, C, HH, CH, R, F, SQ, EQ, SMQ, MQ, RQ).\n",

    "\n",
    "The function returns a one-dimensional list containing the optimal values of the control handles. The length of this list is equal to the length of the control horizon (N) times the number of control handles. The list thus lists all control handles and their optimal values in their respective order. **The optimal policy is assigned to the SEIRSAgeModel object and is only overwritten when a new optimisation is performed. Future work could include the creation of a new object for every optimal policy.** The genetic algorithm will by default use all cores available for the optimisation."
