    "#### General\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEIR model was first proposed in 1929 by two Scottish scientists. It is a compartmental model that subdivides the human population in four types of people : 1) healthy individuals susceptible to the infectious disease, 2) exposed individuals in a latent phase (partially the incubation period), 3) infectious individuals able to transmit the disease and 4) individuals removed from the population either through immunisation or death. Despite being a simple and idealised reality, the SEIR model is used extensively to predict the outbreak of infectious diseases and this was no different during the outbreak in China earlier this year. In this work, we extended the SEIR model to incorporate more expert knowledge on SARS-Cov-2 into the model. The infectious pool is split into four parts. The first is a period of pre-symptomatic infectiousness. Several studies have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission is a dominant transmission mechanism of SARS-Cov-2. After the period of pre-symptomatic transmission, three possible infectious outcomes are modelled. 1) asymptomatic outcome, for patients who show no symptoms at all 2) mild outcome, for patients with mild symptoms, these patients recover at home 3) a mild infection can degress to the point where a hospitalision is needed. The pool of *recovered* individuals from the classical SEIR model is split into an recovered and dead pool. People from the susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic infectious, asymptomatic infectious, mild infectious and recovered pool can be quarantined after having tested positive for Covid-19. Note that for individuals in the susceptible and recovered pools, this corresponds to a *false positive* test. The dynamics of our extended SEIR model are presented in the flowchart below. We make the following assumptions with regard to the general SEIRS dynamics,\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../docs/_static/figs/flowchartAll.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following assumptions with regard to the SEIRS dynamics,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is no connection between the severity of the disease and the infectiousness of an individual. Only the duration of infectiousness can differ.\n",
    "2. All patients experience a brief pre-symptomatic, infectious period.\n",
    "3. All deaths come from intensive care units in hospitals, meaning no patients die outside a hospital. Of the 7703 diseased (01/05/2020), 46\\% died in a hospital while 53\\% died in an elderly home. All hospital deaths are confirmed Covid-19 cases while only 16\\% of elderly home deaths were confirmed. When taking the elderly homes out of the model scope, the assumption that deaths only arise in hospitals is true due to the fact that only 0.3\\% died at home and 0.4\\% died someplace else. Asymptomatic and mild cases automatically lead to recovery and in no case to death (https://www.info-coronavirus.be/nl/news/trends-laatste-dagen-zetten-zich-door/).\n",
    "4. We implement no testing and quarantining in the hospital. Hospitalised persons are assumed to be incapable of infecting susceptibles, so the implementation of a quarantine would not change the dynamics but slow down calculations.\n",
    "5. Recovered patients are assumed to be immune, seasonality is deemed out of scope of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hospital subystem (preliminary)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hospital subsystem is a simplification of actual hospital dynamics. The dynamics and estimated parameters were  obtained by interviewing Ghent University Hospital staff and presenting the resulting meeting notes to the remaining three Ghent hospitals for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing (30/04/2020) every admitted patient is tested for Covid-19. Roughly 10% of all Covid-19 patients at UZ Ghent originally came to the hospital for some other medical condition. The remaining 90% of all Covid-19 arrives in the emergency room or comes from hospitals in heavily struck regions. The fraction of people the hospital when getting infected with Covid-19 are reported to authorities as ‚Äònew hospitalisations‚Äô. There are three hospital wards for Covid-19 patients: 1) Cohort, which should be seen like a regular hospital ward with Covid-19 patients. Patients are not monitored permanently in this ward. 2) Midcare, a ward where more severe cases are monitored more cosely than in Cohort. Midcare is more closely related to ICU than to Cohort and is usually lumped with the number of ICU patients when reporting to the officials. 3) Intensive care, for patients with the most severe symptoms. Intensive care needs can include the use of a ventilator to supply the patient with oxygen. It was noted that the fraction Cohort vs. Midcare and ICU is roughly 50-50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../docs/_static/figs/hospitalRealLife.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, patients can switch between any of the wards depending on how the disease progresses. However, some dominant *flows* exist. Usually, it is apparent upon a patients arrival to which ward he or she will be assigned. On average patients who don‚Äôt degress stay in Cohort for 6 days, with values spread between 3 and 8 days. The average ICU stay is 14 days when a patient doesn‚Äôt need ventilation. If the patient needs ventilation the stay is slightly longer. After being in ICU, patients return to Cohort for an another 6 to 7 days of recovery. Based on these dominant *flows*, the hospital subsystem was simplified by making the following assumptions,\n",
    "1. Assume people arriving at the hospital are instantly distributed between Cohort, Midcare or ICU.\n",
    "2. Merge ventilator and non-ventilator ICU.\n",
    "3. Assume deaths can only arise in ICU.\n",
    "4. Assume all patients in midcare and ICU pass via Cohort on their way to recovery.\n",
    "5. Assume that the 10% of the patients that come from hospital actually come from the population."

    "The extended SEIR model is implemented using two frameworks: a deterministic and a stochastic (network based) framework. **This Jupyter Notebooks is a demo of the deterministic model,** a demo of the stochastic network simulator is available in *SEIRSNetworkModel_Demo*. A deterministic implementation of the extended SEIRS model captures important features of infectious disease dynamics, but it assumes uniform mixing of the population (i.e. every individual in the population is equally likely to interact with every other individual). The deterministic approach results in a set of N ordinary differential equations, one for every of the N ‚Äôpopulation pools‚Äô considered. The main advantage of a deterministic model is that a low amount of computational resources are required while still maintaining an acceptable accuracy. The deterministic framework allows to rapidly explore scenarios and perform optimisations which require thousands of function evaluations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is often important to consider the structure of contact networks when studying disease transmission and the effect of interventions such as social distancing and contact tracing. The main drawback of the deterministic approach is the inability to simulate contact tracing, which is one of the most promising measures against the spread of SARS-Cov-2. For this reason, the SEIRS dynamics depicted in on the above flowchart can be simulated on a Barabasi-Albert network. This advantages include a more detailed analysis of the relationship between social network structure and effective transmission rates, including the effect of network-based interventions such as social distancing, quarantining, and contact tracing. The added value comes at a high price in terms of computational resources. It is not possible to perform optimisations of parameters in the stochastic network model on a personal computer. Instead, high performance computing infrastructure is needed. The second drawback is the need for more data and/or assumptions on social interactions and how government measures affect these social interactions."

    "In the above equations, S stands for susceptible, E for exposed, A for asymptomatic, M for mild, H for hospitalised, C for cohort, Mi for midcare, ICU for intensive care unit, D for dead, R for recovered. The quarantined states are denoted with a Q suffix, for instance AQ stands for asymptomatic and quarantined. The states S, E, A, M and R can be quarantined. The disease dynamics when quarantined are identical to the non quarantined dynamics. For instance, EQ will evolve into AQ or MQ with the same probability as E evolves into A or M. Individuals from the MQ pool can end up in the hospital. N stands for the total population. The clinical parameters are: a, m: the chance of having an asymptomatic or mild infection. h: the fraction of mildly infected which require hospitalisation. c: fraction of the hospitalised which remain in Cohort, mi: fraction of hospitalised which end up in midcare. Based on reported cases in China and travel data, Li et al. (2020b) estimated that 86 % of coronavirus infections in the country were \"undocumented\" in the weeks before officials instituted stringent quarantines. This figure thus includes the asymptomatic cases and an unknown number of mildly symptomatic cases and is thus an overestimation of the asymptotic fraction. In Iceland, citizens were invited for testing regardless of symptoms. Of all people with positive test results, 43% were asymptomatic (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020). The actual number of asymptomatic infections might be even higher since it seemed that symptomatic persons were more likely to respond to the invitation (Sciensano, 2020). In this work it is assumed that 43 % of all infected cases are asymptomatic. This figure can later be corrected in light of large scale immunity testing in the Belgian population. Hence,\n",

Based on interviews with Ghent University hospital staff, midcare is merged with ICU in the offical numbers. For now, it is assumed that the distribution between midcare and ICU is 50-50 %. The sum of both pools is one third of the hospitalisations. Since the average time a patient spends in midcare is equal to ICU, this corresponds to seeing midcare and ICU as 'ICU'."

First, the model parameters, the initial condition and the monte-carlo simulation settings are put inside. The toolbox 'SEIRSAgeModel' not only contains the necessary code to simulate the model, but also contains several convenient functions for data visualisation, calibration of model parameters and model predictive control. The advantage of using an object instead of nested functions is the fact that function arguments don't explicitly have to be passed to the helper functions every time these are called by the user. Rather, the parameters are stored in our 'SEIRSAgeModel' toolbox and can be used by the class functions at any time. This drastically enhances the readability of the code.\n",

    "A first important challenge when using a deterministic model is to link the discrete levels of the control handle Nc (number of contacts) to specific government policies. A model extension that could be used to facilitate this is age-structuring. In this approach, all population pools are split in age-bins and the interactions between the age-bins are governed by a so-called interaction matrix. This modeling approach was recently used by a team of the London School of Hygiene and details can be found here [1]. Our model is written in such a way that incorporating age-structuring is only a matter of change the initial conditions and Nc-matrix sizes. We can already run simulations using the Belgian interaction matrix shown below and we will run the controller using this model in the very near future.\n",

This is done in exactly the same way as before but instead of size-one numpy arrays we will now use a 16x16 interaction interaction matrix and 16x0 size initial conditions, as was demonstrated by the London School of Hygiene. Interaction matrices are publicly available here [2]. We conveniently name our object 'ageModel'.\n",

    "As we have the impression that the control part, which we see as our main addition to the problem, is more difficult to grasp for the layman, here is a short intro to process control. Experts in control are welcome to skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predictive model consists of a set of equations and aims to predict how the system will behave in the future given a certain input. Process control flips this around and aims at determining what input is needed to achieve a desired system behavior (= goal). It is a tool that helps us in ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù how we want a system to behave. It is commonly applied in many industries, but also in our homes (e.g. central heating, washing machine). It's basically everywhere. Here's how it works. An algorithm monitors the deviation between the goal and the true system value and then computes the necessary action to \"drive\" the system to its goal by means of an actuator (in industry this is typically a pump or a valve). Applying this to Covid-19, the government wants to \"control\" the spread of the virus in the population by imposing measures (necessary control actions) on the public (which is the actuator here) and achieve the goal that the number of severely sick people does not become larger than can be handled by the health care system. However, the way the population behaves is a lot more complex compared to the heating control in our homes since not only epidemiology (virus spread) but also different aspects of human behavior on both the individual and the societal level (sociology, psychology, economy) are involved. This leads to multiple criteria we want to ideally control simultaneously and we want to use the \"smartest\" algorithm we can get our hands on.\n",

    "The 'SEIRSAgeModel' class contains an implementation of the MPC controller in the function *optimizePolicy*. For now, the controller minimises a weighted squared sum-of-errors between multiple setpoints and model predictions. The algorithm can use any variable to control the virus outbreak, but we recommend sticking with the number of random daily contacts $N_c$ and the total number of random tests ('totalTests') as only these have been tested. We also recommend disabling age-structuring in the model before running the MPC as this feature requires discretisation of the interaction matrix to work which is not yet implemented. Future work will extend the MPC controller to work with age-structuring feature inherent to the model. Future work is also aimed at including an economic cost function to discriminate between control handles. Our MPC uses a PSO algorithm to perform the optimisation, we recommend using at least a swarmsize of 20 and at least 100 iterations to ensure that the trajectory is 'optimal'.

    "realTimeMPC(startDate, data, positions, pastPolicy,parNames,bounds,setpoints,weights)\n",
    "> - startDate: a string with the date corresponding to the first entry of the dataseries (format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'). \n",
    "> - data: a list containing the dataseries (dtype=np array) to fit the model to. For now, dataseries must be of equal length and start on the same day.\n",
    "> - positions: a list containing the model states (dtype=np.array) used to calculate the sum of least squares. Each dataseries must be matched to a certain (sum of) model state(s). If multiple entries are provided these are added togheter. The order of the states is given according to the following vector, where S has index 0: (S, E, I, A, M, C, Mi, ICU, R, F, SQ, EQ, IQ, AQ, MQ, RQ).\n",
    "> - pastPolicy: a checkpoints dictionary containing past government actions.\n",
    "> - parNames: a list containing the names (dtype=string) of the model parameters to be used as a control handle.\n",
    "> - bounds: A list containing the lower- and upper boundaries of each parameter to be used as a control handle. Each entry in the list should be a 1D numpy array containing the lower- and upper bound for the respective control handle.\n",
    "> - setpoints: A list with the numerical values of the desired model output.\n",
    "> - weights: a list containing the weighting fractions of each population pool ouput in the sum-of-squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following arguments are optional,\n",
    "> - policy_period: length of one policy interval (default: 7 days).\n",
    "> - N: number of future policy intervals to be optimised, also called 'control horizon' (default: 6).\n",
    "> - P: number of policy intervals over which the sum of squared errors is calculated, also called 'prediction horizon' (default:12).\n",
    "> - disp: Show sum-of-least-squares after each optimisation iteration (default: True).\n",
    "> - polish: True to use a Nelder‚ÄìMead simplex to polish the final result (default: True).\n",
    "> - maxiter: Maximum number of iterations (default: 100).\n",
    "> - popsize: Population size of genetic algorithm (default: 20).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following arguments are for visualisation,\n",
    "> - dataMkr: list containing the markers (dtype=str) to be used to visualise the data. Default value works up to five dataseries and is equal to: ['o','v','s','*','^'].\n",
    ">- modelClr: list containing the colors (dtype=str) to be used to visualise the model fit. Default value works up to five dateseries and is equal to: ['green','orange','red','black','blue'].\n",
    "> - legendText: tuple containing the legend entries. Disabled per default.\n",
    "> - titleText: string containing the fit title. Disable per default.\n",
    "> - filename: string with a filename + extension to save the figure. The figure is not saved per default.\n",
    "> - getfig: True to return ax, fig (default: False)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the control handles are not yet incorporated in the visualisation, this will be done in the near future."
